Project Overview:-
------------------

    This is a Book Review API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to:

    Sign up and log in securely using JWT-based authentication.

    Add new books to the database.

    Retrieve lists of books with pagination and filtering options.

    View details of a single book, including its reviews and average rating.

    Search books by title or author.

    Add, update, and delete reviews on books â€” with ownership and authentication enforced.

    The project demonstrates common backend patterns such as RESTful routing, JWT authentication, password hashing, data validation, and MongoDB relationships (using Mongoose).
