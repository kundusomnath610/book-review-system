Book Review Project:-
--------------------
Project Overview:-
------------------

This is a Book Review API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to:

Sign up and log in securely using JWT-based authentication.

Add new books to the database.

Retrieve lists of books with pagination and filtering options.

View details of a single book, including its reviews and average rating.

Search books by title or author.

Add, update, and delete reviews on books â€” with ownership and authentication enforced.

The project demonstrates common backend patterns such as RESTful routing, JWT authentication, password hashing, data validation, and MongoDB relationships (using Mongoose).





Project Setup Instructions:-
---------------------------
Prerequisites:
---------------
Node.js installed (version 14 or later recommended)

MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)

Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

Future Progress:
-----------------

Create a frontend using React.js, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.
It can be connected to SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to support a large user base.
Containerize the application with Docker to simplify collaboration with other developers.
Implement code coverage testing and core functionality tests.
Deploy the application on AWS or Azure.

There are many more future progress and improvement scopes.
